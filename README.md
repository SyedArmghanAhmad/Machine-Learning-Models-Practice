# Machine Learning Models Practice Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Models practice repository! This repository contains various machine learning models implemented to work on real-world scenarios. I created these models as part of my learning journey into machine learning. 

While the models are not perfect and still require improvements, they provide a solid starting point for understanding and practicing common machine learning algorithms.

## Models Included

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
- **Ensemble of Logistic Regression + LDA**
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
- **Ensemble of Logistic Regression + Gaussian Naive Bayes**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Bagging Regressor**
- **AdaBoost Regressor**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

## Project Details

Each model is implemented on a real-world dataset, showcasing different techniques and methodologies in supervised learning. These models cover both regression and classification tasks, offering a hands-on approach to machine learning.

## Contributions

Feel free to explore the models, suggest improvements, or add new ones as I continue to learn and develop my skills in machine learning.
